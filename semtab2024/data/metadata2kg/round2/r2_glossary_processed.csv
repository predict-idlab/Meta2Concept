551,Last Observed,"The most recent year the species or community type was observed in the given county, as documented in the dataset’s source databases. A value of “2000 – 2005” indicates that the species was most recently documented during the second NYS Breeding Bird Atlas Project, conducted from 2000 to 2005. A value of “1990-1999” indicates that the species was most recently documented during the NY Amphibian and Reptile Atlas Project, conducted from 1990 to 1999. A value of “not available” indicates that the species or community type has been recorded in the given county, but no date is available.",LastObserved
552,State Protection Status,"For animals and plants, the legal protected status under New York State Environmental Conservation Law (ECL) and under New York State regulations. The highest level of protection is given to species listed by New York State as Endangered or Threatened. Regulations regarding animals are administered by NYS DEC’s Division of Fish, Wildlife, and Marine Resources. Regulations regarding plants are administered by NYS DEC’s Division of Lands and Forests. For Animals, categories of Endangered, Threatened, and Special Concern species are defined in New York State ECL §11-0535. Endangered, Threatened, and Special Concern species are listed in regulation 6NYCRR 182.5, and at http://www.dec.ny.gov/animals/7494.html. For Plants, categories of Endangered, Threatened, Rare, and Exploitably Vulnerable are defined in ECL §9-1503. Plants in these categories are protected against picking, removal, or damaging with herbicides without the consent of the landowner. Endangered, Threatened, Rare, and Exploitably Vulnerable species are listed in regulation 6NYCRR 193.3, and at http://www.dec.ny.gov/regs/15522.html.",StateProtectionStatus
553,Federal Protection Status,"For animals and plants, the listing status under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, as it applies to populations of the species in New York State. Listing provides legal protection for this species at the federal level. Listing categories are Endangered, Threatened, or Candidate. As defined by the Act, endangered refers to species that are ""in danger of extinction within the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of its range,"" while threatened refers to “those animals and plants likely to become endangered within the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of their ranges.”",FederalProtectionStatus
554,State Conservation Rank,"A rank assigned by New York Natural Heritage to each species and community type indicating how imperiled it is in New York State. The state conservation rank is based on how rare or abundant the species or community type is in New York, its distribution, and on population trends and threats. As new information becomes available, ranks may be revised. The ranks are based on a one to five scale, ranging from S1 = critically imperiled to S5 = demonstrably secure (common and widespread). Natural Heritage conservation status ranks carry no legal or regulatory weight. Basic state conservation ranks are: S1 – Critically Imperiled in New York State S2 – Imperiled in New York State S3 – Vulnerable in New York State S4 – Apparently Secure in New York State S5 – Definitely Secure in New York State (common and widespread) SH – Historical in New York: not seen since before 1980, but could still be present SX—Extirpated: no longer present in New York SU – Unrankable: Currently unrankable due to lack of information or due to substantially conflicting information about status or trends. SNR – Not Ranked: state conservation status not yet assessed. SNA – Not Applicable, because the species is not a suitable target for conservation activities (e.g., species is a hybrid, a domesticated species, not native to New York, an accidental or infrequent visitor outside of its normal range, a transient migrant just passing through the state, or a species with only unconfirmed or doubtful reports). Variations of these ranks include: • Range ranks, such as S1S2, indicate not enough information is available to distinguish between two single ranks. • ? after a rank, such as S2?, indicates some uncertainty about the true rank, but is most likely the assigned rank. • B after a rank, such as S2B, indicates the rank applies to the breeding populations in New York of a migratory animal. • N after a rank, such as S3N, indicates the rank applies to the non-breeding populations in New York of a migratory animal.",StateConservationRank
555,Global Conservation Rank,"A rank assigned by New York Natural Heritage to each species and community type indicating how imperiled the species or community type is throughout the world. The global conservation rank is based on how rare the species or community type is across its global range, and on population trends and threats. For species, these ranks provide an estimate of extinction risk; while for natural communities, they provide an estimate of the risk of elimination. As new information becomes available, ranks may be revised. The ranks are based on a one to five scale, ranging from G1 = critically imperiled to G5 = demonstrably secure (common and widespread). Natural Heritage conservation status ranks carry no legal or regulatory weight. Basic global conservation ranks are: G1 – Critically Imperiled (very high risk of extinction) G2 – Imperiled (high risk of extinction) G3 – Vulnerable (moderate risk of extinction) G4 – Apparently Secure (uncommon but not rare) G5 – Definitely Secure (common and widespread) GH – Possibly Extinct: not seen anywhere in last 30, but could still exist GX – Extinct: no longer present anywhere in the world GU – Unrankable: Currently unrankable due to lack of information or due to substantially conflicting information about status or trends. GNR – Not Ranked: global conservation status not yet assessed. GNA – Not Applicable, because the species is not a suitable target for conservation activities (e.g., species is a hybrid, or a domesticated species). Variations of these ranks include: • Range ranks, such as G1G2, indicate not enough information is available to distinguish between two single ranks. • ? after a rank, such as G2?, indicates some uncertainty about the true rank, but is most likely the assigned rank. • T ranks, such as T3, indicate the rank applies to a subspecies or variety, but not to the species as a whole.",GlobalConservationRank
556,County Presence Status,"Status of the presence of the species or natural community type in the given county, as recorded in the dataset’s source databases. Values are: Recently confirmed = Documented, with confirmed identification, since 1980. Historically confirmed = Last documented, with confirmed identification, before 1980; current presence is unknown, but could still be present. Possible, but not confirmed = Has not been documented but has been confirmed nearby, or has been reported but identification has not been confirmed. Extirpated = Has been documented in the past, but is now believed to no longer occur in the given county.",CountyPresenceStatus
